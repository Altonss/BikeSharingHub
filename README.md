# BikeSharingHub

BikeSharingHub is an Android application that displays the availability of shared bikes in your city.

It uses the [CityBikes API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) that provides data for more than 400 cities in around 40 countries and displays this data in a list or on an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) layer thanks to the [osmdroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) library (multiple layers are available).

It is a fork of the [OpenBikeSharing](https://github.com/bparmentier/OpenBikeSharing) application, which adds few improvements for recent Android versions.

Bug reports and feature requests can be reported in [Issues](https://github.com/francoisfds/BikeSharingHub/issues).

## Build

If you use Android Studio, you can import the project directly from GitHub.

Otherwise you can build it from the command line with
[Gradle](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html).
Clone the repo and type:

    ./gradlew build

(You may need to `chmod +x` the `gradlew` script)

The Gradle script will take care of downloading the necessary libraries and will generate the APK's
in `app/build/outputs/apk`.
