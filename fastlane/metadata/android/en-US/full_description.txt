<p>
BikeSharingHub displays the availability of shared bikes in more than 400 cities. Yours must be supported !
</p>
<p>
It syncs with an Open-Source API called <a href="https://api.citybik.es">CityBik.es</a>, which gathers open data provided by the available shared bikes operators.
</p>
<p>
It is based on the <a href="https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/be.brunoparmentier.openbikesharing.app/">OpenBikeSharing</a> application, with few improvements for recent Android versions.
