<p>
BikeSharingHub displays the availability of shared bikes among hundreds of cities in the same application.
</p>
<p>
Data is fetched from the CityBik.es API, which gathers open data provided by the available shared bikes operators. This API is open-source and the application allows to set another API URL than the default.
</p>
<p>
It is based on the OpenBikeSharing application (repo "F-Droid Archive").
